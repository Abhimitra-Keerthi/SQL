As a demonstration of my SQL skills, Iâ€™ve written a query to solve the problem of finding the total number of customers who visited a website for the first time on each day in 2024. Hereâ€™s the solution based on a sample customer activity table:

Sample Table:
Timestamp	Customer ID	Customer Name	Purchase Status
17-10-2024 10:05	1001	John Doe	TRUE
17-10-2024 10:15	1002	Jane Smith	FALSE
17-10-2024 10:20	1003	Alex Johnson	TRUE
17-10-2024 10:22	1004	Emily Davis	FALSE
17-10-2024 10:35	1005	Michael Lee	TRUE
17-10-2024 10:45	1006	Sarah Brown	FALSE
18-10-2024 10:22	1004	Emily Davis	FALSE
18-10-2024 10:35	1005	Michael Lee	TRUE
18-10-2024 10:45	1006	Sarah Brown	FALSE
19-10-2024 10:35	1005	Michael Lee	TRUE
19-10-2024 10:45	1006	Sarah Brown	FALSE
Objective:
To find the total number of customers who visited the website for the first time on each day.

SQL Solution:
sql
Copy code
WITH cte_1 AS (
    SELECT LEFT(datestr, 10) AS dates, customerid AS cid 
    FROM Table
)

SELECT SUM(t) AS total_number_of_customers 
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(cid) AS t 
    FROM cte_1
    WHERE cid NOT IN (
        SELECT cid 
        FROM cte_1 
        WHERE dates = (SELECT dates FROM cte_1 ORDER BY dates ASC LIMIT 1)
    )
    UNION ALL
    SELECT COUNT(cid) 
    FROM cte_1 
    WHERE dates = (SELECT dates FROM cte_1 ORDER BY dates ASC LIMIT 1)
) s;
Explanation:
The CTE (Common Table Expression) extracts the date and customer ID from the timestamp.
The query calculates the first-time visitors by excluding customers who visited on earlier days.
The result is summed to get the total number of customers.
